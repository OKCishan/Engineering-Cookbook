**What is Service Mesh - a distributed system that controls the configuration and behavior of all your microservices**

Service Mesh is not a buzzword! It can do the following-
- Finding sudden drop in performance of a service
- Access control between services communication
- Distributing traffic, load balancing of services with an even balance proportion of servers
- A/B Blue-Green or geography-based release, canary deployment
- Network security, ingress,  etc

**"The service mesh brings benefits by acting as a single source of data collection about inter-service communication and traffic in and out of the microservices ecosystem."**
