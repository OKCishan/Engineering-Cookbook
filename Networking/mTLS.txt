TLS (Transport Layer Security) :  
encrypts communication between client & server. 
Exchanges symmetric keys using a key exchange algorithm. So every message is encrypted before sending,
so it is not a plain text anymore and no one can modify.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we establish TCP connection, followed by TLS handshake, 
then server comes back with a certificate saying, as backend server I'm configured to ask for your(client) certificate,
and complete this handshake.

mTLS :: additionally asks for client certificate.

The server will verify this certificate provided by client against some store (using domain name etc).
mTLS will be rejected if client certificate is rejected or server certificate is rejected.

Advantages:
1. If some phished and got my password/API key, mTLS will prevent, since they will have to present client certificate. Client trust is extreme level security.
2. Microservices - a microservice server, can mention the services that can connect to it via API gateway access.
3. To add a new service, you need to add it to search store & make client service also trust.

Disadvantages:
1.
